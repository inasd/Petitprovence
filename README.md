# petitprovence
For my grandmother

Hello, nice to meet you. I'm korean and high school student.

First, I don't recommened you seeing my coding files, becuase I'm yet beginner of coding.
I started learning coding from 2018.12.3, so I don't know nothing but HTML. (And a little of CSS and javascript and w3.css)

petitprovence.html is almost made by my father, and I'm just adjusting some bug(improper use of div or etc.)
My aim is make petitprovence enough to be attractive, which I can help my grandmother's business.
So I want be master of coding :D 

I like pewdiepie and english web sites that help students to learn many thing in thier home. (Because I like homeschooling too, LOL)
